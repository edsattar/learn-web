[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/content-collections)

This is the project you'll build with the [Astro Tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/). Use this code to compare to your own, or explore to see how the basics of a blog are built in Astro!

This branch contains the state of the project after completing the final unit, [Unit 6](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/6-islands/3/), and migrating to content collections.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
